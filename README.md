**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2021a. Compatible with R2021a and later releases._  

## Description ##
This package contains _[live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html)_ and supporting files to teach the 
fundamental concepts in probability theory and statistical inference. These materials are designed to be flexible and can be easily 
modified to accommodate a variety of teaching and learning methods. Used in a sequence, the live scripts progressively add depth to 
the topic. However, each script or section can be easily adapted for standalone use. The live scripts include a brief background, 
interactive illustrations, tasks, reflection questions, and application examples. 

This module can be used as part of a lecture, as activities in an instructional setting, or as interactive assignments to be completed 
outside of class. The live script sections contains direct instructions or tasks to illustrate the basics and additional reflection 
questions that are more open-ended.

Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, 
when an animation is in progress), use the **Stop** button in the **Run** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB toolstrip.

## Prerequisite Domain Knowledge ##
This module assumes a knowledge of basic concepts in set theory, such as ⋃ (union) and ⋂ (intersection). It also assumes basic 
fluency in mathematical notation for Σ (summation) and Π (product). Other notation relevant to probability theory is introduced 
within the module as needed.

## Suggested Prework ## 
[MATLAB Onramp](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html) – a free two-hour introductory tutorial to learn the essentials of MATLAB®.
